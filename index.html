      TDWB is a top-down .io-style hero shooter. TDWB is currently in the Beta phase, with playable gameplay, but bugs and unfinished content. Designed for simplicity, TDWB is designed to be easy to learn and hard to master. Play TDWB with your keyboard and mouse, or a game controller.

      <h1>Game Info </h1>
    <h2>Simplicity</h2>
    <p>
      TDWB has only 2 gameplay mechanics in battle: move and shoot. This makes TDWB easy to learn. When you've figured out your playstyle, find a hero that fits your style and play as them!
    </p>
    <h2>Online Multiplayer</h2>
    <p>
      TDWB is an online multiplayer game. You can invite your friends to play along with you, find others online, and even create private matches! The ranking system only takes into effect the number of kills you get before you die. If you don't get kills, your rank decreases. The more kills you get, the more your rank increases.
    </p>
    <h2>Unique Skins</h2>
    <p>
      We think you should be rewarded from your hard work, even if you lose. Gun skins are a way to show off your game playtime as well as skill. Find gun skins in the store and through TDWBoxes.
    </p>
    <h2>Lootbox System</h2>
    <p>
      We know it's frustrating to open a lootbox only to get an item you can't use, already own, or just don't like. Our lootbox system allows you to choose ANY eligible reward from lootboxes. Opening a legendary lootbox will always allow you to pick out the item you want!
    </p>
    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>
      We know sometimes it can be hard finding people to play with, so join the Discord server to chat with the community, find major announcements, participate in events, and more. Make sure to invite your friends!
